## Hi, my name is Angelo! 

I'm a biomechanical engineering student at Queen's University (2021 candidate). With over one year of industry experience developing firmware for embedded devices, I'm seeking to use my knowledge of product development lifecycles to support new product bring-ups.

### Skills
#### I use **CAD** for **rapid prototyping**
Turning doodles on scrap paper into something I can hold in my hands fills me with wonder and pride. I have experience using a variety of CAD software, including Solid Edge, NX and Fusion 360, including animation and basic surfacing.

I'm especially interested in using FFF 3D printers for prototyping. A personal 3D printer has enabled me to take personal "making" to the next level. Through printing various objects, many of my own design, including enclosures, gears, decor and PPE (3D PPE Kingston), I understand how to design  and optimize for the use of this technology and am mindful of it's limitations.

#### I **code** and **debug hardware**
Since learning Java, I've also worked with C++, C#, Python and Javascript at a proficient level. With my familiarity with Java, I was a passionate native Android developer for several years. Having implemented projects with Javascript and JQuery, however, I'm now looking to experiment with React to break free from a specific OS with PWAs that run on (almost) any device. 

Most recently, I worked at Cisco Meraki in Software Platform Engineering where I tinkered with embedded bootloaders and kernels for upcoming networking products. Seeing a new PCBA finally boot using a bootloader I’d built was hugely satisfying.

I was intimitely involved in implenting various security technologies in assigned products. These systems rely on peripherals including trust anchors, so communication busses were of upmost interest. I validated SPI, UART, I2C and PCIe busses, among others, powering everything from Serial EEPROMs to PCIe ethernet controllers, both through internal (software) and external (electrical charateristics) means. Notably, I have experience using JTAG tools to debug Intel x86 processors in the server and mobile product families, certain ARM processors and Microchip FPGAs.

#### I **organize** and **communicate** program milestones
Through design team and work experience, I have

#### I use **external resources** effectively
My time at Cisco Meraki involved extensive communication with engineers, manufacturing teams and vendors to solve problems and ensure that our deliverables were fully specified and on track.

### Fun Facts
On days off, I love backcountry camping, am in the middle of a marathon training plan and am chasing the perfect settings for my 3D printer (currently making PPE!). Please feel free to reach out-I’m always open to new opportunities!
