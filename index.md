## Hi, my name is Angelo! 


I'm a software (BSP) engineer at Cisco Meraki. I attended Queen's University (Kingston) for biomechanical engineering (Sc’21). I love backcountry camping (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/naturewithangelo/">nature Instagram</a>), running and making random mechatronic projects. Please feel free to reach out-I’m always open to chatting.

All projects and thoughts shared on this site are my own and not property of my employer.

#### I use **CAD** for **rapid prototyping**
  </summary>

Turning doodles on scrap paper into something I can hold in my hands fills me with wonder and excitement. I have experience using CAD software, including Solid Edge, NX and Fusion 360, including animation and basic surfacing. I have some ANSYS experience (ADPL).

I'm especially interested in using FFF 3D printers for prototyping. A personal 3D printer has enabled me to take personal "making" to the next level. Through many projects, several of my own design, including enclosures, gears, decor and PPE (3D PPE Kingston), I understand how to design and optimize for the use of this technology and am mindful of its limitations.

#### I **code** and **debug hardware**
  </summary>
  <section markdown="1">
Since learning Java, I've also worked with C++, C#, Python and Javascript at a proficient level. I was a passionate native Android developer for several years. With project experience using Javascript and JQuery, however, I'm now experimenting with React and PWAs that run on (almost) any device. 

I worked at Cisco Meraki doing Software Platform Engineering where I worked on embedded bootloaders and kernels for networking products. Seeing a new PCBA finally boot using a bootloader I’d built was hugely satisfying.

I was intimately involved in implementing various security technologies that relied on peripherals including trust anchors, so communication busses were of upmost interest. I validated SPI, UART, I2C and PCIe busses, among others, powering everything from Serial EEPROMs to PCIe ethernet controllers, both through internal (software) and external (electrical characteristics) means. Notably, I have experience using JTAG tools to debug Intel x86 processors for server/mobile and certain ARM processors and FPGAs.

#### I **organize** and **communicate** program milestones
  </summary>
  <section markdown="1">
I enjoy being involved in the planning and aggregation of team work because it increases my scope of understanding in product development. In established orgs, I have recognized and tested improvements to processes and technical systems, then presented these results to both technical and non-technical audiences.

Through design team and work experience, I have experience recording and communicating work using many tools, including Microsoft Teams, Atlassian tools (Jira, Confluence) for Agile and Git/Gerrit for CI.

#### I use **external resources** effectively
  </summary>
  <section markdown="1">
When given a release goal, I'm able to communicate with engineers, manufacturing teams and vendors to ensure that our deliverables are fully specified and on track. I have experience escalating and working with external FAEs, sales and engineering teams to solve implementation problems while maintaining company confidentiality protocols. Through direct communication with overseas manufacturing teams, I have been able to deliver software that better aligns with their processes and fix problems with greater efficiency. I recognize the power of open source software and have contributed to the testing of community-maintained repositories.

### Contribution
As part of a team, I hope to contribute extensively in project prototyping and communication. My curiosity and experience with working with embedded systems, CAD and external partners make me an good addition to any team hoping to create a proof of concept. I enjoy presenting our successes to outside teams, both technical and non-technical.

### Goals
I want to build products that have a definite positive impact on people. Some fields of particular interest:
* Technology to improve medical logistics
* Connectivity and networking

I hope that I can always work with new and upcoming technologies at a place that encourages continuous professional and personal exploration and growth.
