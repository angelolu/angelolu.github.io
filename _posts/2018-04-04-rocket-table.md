##### Coursework (APSC 202)

<img src="/assets/images/rocket_table.jpg" alt="assembled rocket case/table prototype in table configuration" style="width:90%;max-width:600px;"/>

For this project, we were paired with one of the model rocket design teams who was seeking a device to transport, assemble and display their rocket. They are limited by the transport capacity of a small vehicle so wanted a compact system that transforms to meet these goals. Additionally, the case must be light enough for two people to carry once fully loaded.

Our team created this design and prototype mostly out of plywood and 2x2 lumber for the frame and rigid insulation foam for padding. The total cost was $85.26 CAD.

The legs of the table pack into the sides of the box and can be inserted into the pockets to transform the top of the box into a tabletop.

Possible improvements include the manufacture of plastic slots for the legs to fit into, as shown below. The more precise slot fit over the warped plywood panels would give the table more stability.
