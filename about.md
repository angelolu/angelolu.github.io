Hi there,

My name is Angelo Lu. I'm a biomechanical engineering and computer science student at Queen's University (2020 and 2022 candidate, respectively). 

I'm working towards completing the requirements for my mech eng degree first, fitting compsci courses in remaining elective slots. To learn more about tech, I like building small projects on my time off and am involved in a couple teams.

### Currently involved in
* **Queen's Mostly Autonomous Sailboat Team (QMAST)** as a manager of the software subteam
* **Queen's Fuel Cell Team (QFCT)** as a member of the mechanical team
* **Queen's Varsity Triathlon Club (QTri)** as website developer and a member of the developmental club

### Interests
* **Product development** especially with prototyping using FFF/FDM techniques and the development of accessible 3D printing in general
* **Automation and robotics** 
  * There's just something so satisfying about simplifying complex tasks to run at the push of a button
* **Project management**
* **Running** 
  * I'm looking to do my first marathon in 2019?
